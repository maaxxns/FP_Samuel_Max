In \autoref{sec:lec_laser} you can clearly see the threshold for lasing.
Although the voltage is only minimally different, the light from the laser is significantly brighter and the typical speckle pattern of laser light is visible.
This is in line with the expectation based on the population inversion.
\\
The Rubidium in \autoref{sec:rubidium} absorbs some of the laser light, as expected.
This indicates that the laser was set correctly.
\\
The final result in \autoref{sec:absorption} shows the four absorption lines of $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb.
One problem was the sunlight from the window, which had an impact on the detectors.
For better results the room can be completely isolated from sunlight.
\\
Another problem was that the knob were probably not set optimally, because the smallest changes had large effects on the laser.
Also we have not changed the top button, but there is the possibility that this was not optimal in the mode.
All in all, the results are good but can be improved with more precise adjustments.
