\section{Objective}
\label{sec:Zielsetzung}

This Experiment focusses on the production of Laser light.
To produce the Laser light a Diode Laser is used.
With this we examine the Absorption Spectrum of Rubidium vapor by shooting the Laser into the vapor.
Our goal is to measure a clear Absorption Spectrum of the light by the Rubidium vapor.
